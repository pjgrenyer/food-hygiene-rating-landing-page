                    </p>

                    <h2>What information do we collect and how is it used?</h2>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Business Users:</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h1>How will we protect your information?</h1>

                    <p>
                        We will apply appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure your personal information is secure.  For example, we have systems in place to
                        ensure that access to personal information is restricted to authorised individuals on a strictly need-to-know basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we need to share personal data with our contractors and third party suppliers, our relationships are governed by our contracts with them which include
                        strict data sharing and confidentiality protocols. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To help us ensure confidentiality of your personal information we may ask you (and any of your representatives) security questions to confirm your identity
                        when you call us and as may be necessary when we call you. We will not discuss your personal information with anyone other than you, unless you have given
                        us prior written authorisation to do so or where we have received a clear verbal instruction from you (as a one-off circumstance). 
                    </p>
                    <h1>Who will we share your information with?</h1>

                    <p>
                        <strong>We never share personal information with any other organisation for third-party marketing purposes.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes we will need to share personal information we hold about you with other organisations, however when sharing information we will comply with all
                        aspects of data protection law. All our data sharing relationships are governed by contracts which include strict data sharing and confidentiality
                        protocols. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We may also share information when required by law, for example, where ordered by the Court or to protect an individual from immediate harm.</p>

                    <h1>What are your rights in relation to your data?</h1>
                    <p>We are committed to upholding your rights in respect of your personal data.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The right to be informed</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the provision of this and other privacy notices on the website, we will be open and transparent about how and why we use your personal information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The right of access</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You have a right to ask us what personal information we hold about you and to request a copy of your information. This is known as a ‘subject access
                        request’ (SAR).
                    </p>
                    <p>SARs need to be made in writing and we ask that your written request is accompanied by proof of your address and identity.</p>

                    <p>
                        If you are seeking to obtain specific information (e.g. about a particular matter or from a particular time period), it helps if you clarify the details of
                        what you would like to receive in your written request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If someone is requesting information on your behalf they will need written confirmation from you to evidence your consent for us to release this and proof
                        of ID (both yours and theirs).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have 30 calendar days within which to provide you with the information you’ve asked for (although we will try to provide this to you as promptly as
                        possible).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>The right to rectification</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can ask us to rectify your personal data if it is inaccurate or incomplete. Please help us to keep our records accurate by keeping us informed if your
                        details change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The right to erasure</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no
                        compelling reason for its continued processing.  This is not an absolute right, and we will need to consider the circumstances of any such request and
                        balance this against our need to continue processing the data.  Our response will also be guided by the provisions of our retention schedule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The right to object</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>You can tell us you object to us processing your data to provide our services to you. The remedy will be to remove your data from our service.</p>

                    <p>
                        We only holds records during the period of our relationship and for a set period afterwards to allow us to meet our legal obligations, including resolving
                        any follow up issues between us.{' '}
